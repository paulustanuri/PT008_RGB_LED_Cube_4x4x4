# PT008_RGB_LED_Cube_4x4x4
RGB LED Cube 4x4x4 aka. Charliecube

This project actually a remake of Asher Glick's Charliecube. His original version is well documented at 
https://aglick.com/charliecube.html
and his original code can be checked at 
https://github.com/AsherGlick/Charliecube

I made the custom board and kits for this project, based on his works. 
And also made modification at the code to incorporate the use of Soft Latched circuit embedded at the board.
